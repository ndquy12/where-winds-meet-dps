// The endurance half of the Nameless Spear talent `endlessGale` carries the
// other half of: "When you have Endless Gale or Endurance is below 60%,
// increases Affinity DMG based on Affinity Rate, up to an 18% increase at 30%
// Affinity Rate" (in-game talent panel, 2026-08-15). One bonus behind two
// conditions, so it yields nothing while the Endless Gale window is already
// paying it — both at once would double it.
//
// The engine tracks no endurance, so the toggle means "assume the window is
// open for the whole rotation" rather than following a live value. It is off
// by default because the reference rotation only holds it for a fraction of
// its rows, and unlike the other endurance buffs it reaches everything — the
// workbook attaches it to the mystics and Daunting Strike as readily as to the
// sword energy attacks.
